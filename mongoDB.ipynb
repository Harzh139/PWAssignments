            "Q1: Key differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:\n",
            "    - Structure: SQL uses structured tables with fixed schema, NoSQL uses flexible document/key-value structures\n",
            "    - Schema: SQL requires predefined schema, NoSQL is schema-less or schema-flexible\n",
            "    - Scaling: SQL scales vertically, NoSQL scales horizontally\n",
            "    - ACID: SQL guarantees full ACID properties, NoSQL may sacrifice some for performance\n",
            "    - Query Language: SQL uses structured query language, NoSQL uses various query methods\n",
            "    - Relationships: SQL uses JOINs, NoSQL embeds documents or uses references\n",
            "\n",
            "Q2: What makes MongoDB a good choice for modern applications:\n",
            "    - Flexible schema design accommodates evolving data requirements\n",
