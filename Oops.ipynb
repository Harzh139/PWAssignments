        "# THEORETICAL QUESTIONS (1-25)\n",
        "# =================================\n",
        "\n",
        "\"\"\"\n",
        "1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "Answer: OOP is a programming paradigm based on objects that contain data (attributes)\n",
        "and code (methods). It focuses on creating reusable code through classes and objects,\n",
        "emphasizing encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "Answer: A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the\n",
        "structure and behavior that objects of that type will have, including attributes\n",
        "and methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "Answer: An object is an instance of a class. It's a concrete entity created from\n",
        "a class template that has actual values for the attributes defined in the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "Answer:\n",
        "- Abstraction: Hiding complex implementation details and showing only essential features\n",
        "- Encapsulation: Bundling data and methods together and controlling access to them\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "Answer: Dunder (double underscore) methods are special methods that start and end\n",
        "with double underscores (__method__). They define how objects behave with built-in\n",
        "operations (e.g., __init__, __str__, __add__).\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP?\n",
        "Answer: Inheritance allows a class to acquire properties and methods from another class.\n",
        "The child class inherits from the parent class, promoting code reusability.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "Answer: Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects\n",
        "of a common base class. The same method name can behave differently for different classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "Answer: Through access modifiers:\n",
        "- Public: normal attributes/methods\n",
        "- Protected: single underscore (_attribute)\n",
        "- Private: double underscore (__attribute)\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        "Answer: The __init__ method is the constructor. It's called automatically when\n",
        "an object is created and is used to initialize the object's attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        "Answer:\n",
        "- Class methods: Use @classmethod decorator, receive cls as first parameter\n",
        "- Static methods: Use @staticmethod decorator, don't receive special first parameter\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        "Answer: Python doesn't support traditional method overloading. You can simulate\n",
        "it using default parameters or *args, **kwargs.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        "Answer: When a child class provides a different implementation of a method\n",
        "that exists in the parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        "Answer: @property decorator allows methods to be accessed like attributes,\n",
        "providing getter, setter, and deleter functionality.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        "Answer: It enables code flexibility, reusability, and maintainability by allowing\n",
        "the same interface to work with different types of objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        "Answer: A class that cannot be instantiated and typically contains one or more\n",
        "abstract methods that must be implemented by subclasses. Created using ABC module.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
        "Answer: Code reusability, modularity, easier maintenance, better organization,\n",
        "encapsulation of data, inheritance, and polymorphism.\n",
        "\n",
        "17. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
        "Answer:\n",
        "- Class variables: Shared by all instances of the class\n",
        "- Instance variables: Unique to each instance\n",
        "\n",
        "18. What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
        "Answer: A class can inherit from multiple parent classes simultaneously.\n",
        "\n",
        "19. Explain the purpose of '__str__' and '__repr__' methods in Python?\n",
        "Answer:\n",
        "- __str__: Returns human-readable string representation\n",
        "- __repr__: Returns unambiguous string representation for debugging\n",
        "\n",
        "20. What is the significance of the 'super()' function in Python?\n",
        "Answer: super() gives access to methods in a parent class from a child class,\n",
        "enabling method extension rather than complete override.\n",
        "\n",
        "21. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "Answer: Destructor method called when an object is about to be destroyed.\n",
        "Used for cleanup operations.\n",
        "\n",
        "22. What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n",
        "Answer:\n",
        "- @staticmethod: No special first parameter, can't access class/instance data\n",
        "- @classmethod: Receives cls as first parameter, can access class data\n",
        "\n",
        "23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
        "Answer: Child classes can override parent methods, and the correct method\n",
        "is called based on the actual object type at runtime.\n",
        "\n",
        "24. What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
        "Answer: Technique where methods return self, allowing multiple method calls\n",
        "to be chained together in a single statement.\n",
        "\n",
        "25. What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n",
        "Answer: Makes an instance callable like a function by defining what happens\n",
        "when parentheses are used on an object.\n",
        "\"\"\"\n",
